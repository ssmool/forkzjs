FORKZ GENAIX:

This is a conceptual design for the forkz-cli.sh script, based on the provided prompt and the assumed functionality of forkzjs. Since actually implementing the complex data encoding, data conversion, fetching external JavaScript files, and intricate JSON/HTML assembly logic within a pure shell script is highly impractical and unreliable, the following script focuses on the CLI interaction, variable assignment, and a simulated assembly step.

To truly achieve the full functionality described, a more robust language like Node.js, Python, or Ruby would be required to handle file operations, external API calls (for media), JSON manipulation, Base64 encoding, and ZIP file generation reliably.

The script below uses read for user input and case statements for flow control.

Explanation of Variables and Logic
Step	Variable	Logic/Notes
0	forkz_project	Stores the project name, sanitized to be a valid directory name.
1	forkz_type	Stores the numerical choice (1-4) representing the data source type (e.g., 1 for json, 2 for csv). Used in the HTML generation logic for conversion.
2	forkz_stream	Stores the file path(s) entered by the user, separated by a semicolon (;).
3	forkz_dom	Stores the numerical choice (1-4) representing the layout (e.g., 1 for list, 4 for dashboard). Used to select the HTML template URL in the generation function.
4	forkz_search	Stores Y or N. If Y, the forkz_generate_html function adds the <script src="/_forkz/_forkz_searchbar.js"> tag.
5	forkz_media	Stores Y or N. If Y, the script confirms media integration is requested. (The actual complex media JSON creation is too much for a simple shell script and is skipped/simulated.)
6	forkz_zip	Stores Y or N. If Y, the [ASSEMBLY] block executes.

Assembly Flow Simulation
Directory Setup: Creates the main project folder ($forkz_project) and the required subdirectories (_data and _forkz_assets).

Data Encoding (forkz_assemble_data): Simulates taking the input data ($forkz_stream), encoding it with Base64, and saving it as _data/_forkz_data64_guid.skalz.

Media (forkz_media): If requested, a message confirms that complex media JSON (forkzvision) would normally be added to the .skalz data file after an interactive search.

HTML Generation (forkz_generate_html): Creates the index.html. It incorporates:

The selected layout's template URL placeholder as a comment.

The forkzjs.js script.

A simulated forkz_remote() call if the data source isn't JSON.

The searchbar script call if $forkz_search is Y.

ZIP Generation (forkz_generate_zip): Uses the zip command with the -e flag to create an encrypted ZIP file ($forkz_project.zip). It generates a random password and displays it to the user.
